# Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Make sure all files are committed to your repository
2. **Connect to Railway**: Link your GitHub repository to Railway
3. **Set Environment Variables** (if using env vars instead of hardcoded values):
   - `BOT_TOKEN=8327175937:AAGpC7M85iY-kbMVAcKJTrhXzKokWLGctCo`
   - `BOT_USERNAME=@Easy_uknowbot`
4. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically build and deploy

## Pre-Deployment Validation

Run the test script to validate everything works:
\`\`\`bash
python test_bot.py
\`\`\`

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Dependency Issues Fixed
- Updated `python-telegram-bot` from v13.15 to v20.7
- Resolved urllib3 compatibility conflicts
- Fixed import statements for new library version

### 2. Code Modernization
- Converted all handlers to async/await pattern
- Replaced deprecated `Updater` with `Application`
- Updated `Filters` to `filters` (lowercase)
- Fixed `ParseMode` import from `telegram.constants`
- Removed deprecated `InputMediaPhoto` usage

### 3. Railway Optimization
- Optimized Dockerfile for Railway environment
- Added health checks for better monitoring
- Configured proper Python 3.12 base image
- Added security improvements (non-root user)

## Bot Configuration

The bot is configured with:
- **Token**: `8327175937:AAGpC7M85iY-kbMVAcKJTrhXzKokWLGctCo`
- **Username**: `@Easy_uknowbot`

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Run `python test_bot.py` locally to catch issues
4. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## Features Preserved

All original bot functionality is maintained:
- Product link processing for multiple e-commerce platforms
- Advanced mode with stock checking
- Image processing and optimization
- Rate limiting and caching
- Command handlers (/start, /help, /status, etc.)
